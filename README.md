# XRP SigVerify: Blockchain Signature Validation Platform ðŸ“œðŸ”’

Your premier platform for secure and transparent document signing and signature validation powered by the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org). In an era defined by digital transactions, the integrity and authenticity of important documents are of utmost importance. While traditional methods falter in transparency and are prone to tampering, XRP SigVerify rises above by leveraging the robust features of blockchain technology.

## Embracing the XRPL's Strengths ðŸ’ª

- **Decentralized Security**: Eliminating single points of failure.
- **Immutable Records**: Assuring the permanence and untampered state of signed documents.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring verifiable authenticity without intermediaries.
- **Fast and Economical Transactions**: Swift validations without exorbitant costs.
- **Global Reach**: Access and verify from anywhere in the world.
- **Cryptographic Excellence**: Ensuring top-tier security for all transactions.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling high volumes seamlessly.
- **Future-Ready**: Poised to integrate smart contract capabilities as they evolve on the XRPL.

Building on the tried-and-tested foundation of the XRPL, we're not only enhancing trust in the document signing process but also streamlining development, aligning with our mission to provide the best in the domain.

## Steps To Run Project

1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the `sigVerify-frontend` directory in the terminal and run 'npm i' to install all front-end dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `sigVerify-backend` directory in the terminal and run 'npm i' to install all back-end dependencies.
4. Copy the `.env.dist` file in the root of the `sigVerify-backend` directory to create a new file named `.env`. Add your API key and secret for Xaman API in the `.env` file. <br />
   ```bash
   Xaman_API_KEY="api key here"
   Xaman_API_SECRET="api secret here"
   POSTGRES_HOST="sigverify-database"
   POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD="postgres"
   POSTGRES_DB="sigverifydb"

   MAIL_HOST="sigverify-mailcatcher"
   MAIL_PORT=1025
   MAIL_USERNAME=""
   MAIL_PASSWORD=""
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@ledgerintegrations.com"
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="Ledger Integrations"
   ```
5. Execute 'docker-compose up -d' in the `sigVerify-backend` terminal.
6. Open a second terminal, navigate to `sigVerify-frontend`, and execute 'npm run dev' in the terminal. Then, navigate to the outputted localhost URL.
7. For current development and testing, switch Xaman's advanced setting to use XRPL test node: `wss://testnet.xrpl-labs.com`. The XRPL backend web socket is already pre-configured to the XRPL testnet: `wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233` for you.
